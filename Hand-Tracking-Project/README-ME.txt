To run this hand project without and error I uninstalled the latest version of cvzone and installed the version 1.5.0 using :-
pip install cvzone==1.5.0

So after doing this my hand project was running fine but when I went to run my AI keyboard it was not running as it requires the latest version of cvzone. So this means that at one time I can run only 1 project at a time. 

So to run hand project follow these steps :-
1:- open cmd
2:- type in cmd "pip uninstall cvzone"
3:- once it is done type "pip install cvzone==1.5.0"

So to run AI keyboard project follow these steps :- 
1:- open cmd
2:- type in cmd "pip uninstall cvzone"
3:- once it is done type "pip install cvzone"

By following these two methods I can run both of the projects very easily.

Thanks.
